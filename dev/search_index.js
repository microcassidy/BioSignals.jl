The core I/O functionality is based on the Waveform Database (WFDB) specifications..\n\nThis package is heavily inspired by the original WFDB Software Package, and initially aimed to replicate many of its command-line APIs. However, the projects are independent, and there is no promise of consistency between the two, beyond each package adhering to the core specifications.\n\nWaveformDB.jl can be used to read an ECG signal e.g.:\n\njulia> using WaveformDB\n\njulia> rdrecord(\"foo.hea\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"}]
